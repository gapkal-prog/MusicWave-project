# MusicWave data dictionary

Schema version: `0.11.0`

## Post type

| Key | Purpose | REST | Public |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `mw_release` | Canonical track, single, EP, album, mix, playlist, or podcast release | Yes | Yes |

### Permalinks (Core 0.12.0)

Single release URLs follow the primary `mw_release_type` term (ancestors are
consulted for child terms). The post type's own `/music/%mw_release%`
permastruct stays registered as the fallback and as the archive base
(`/music/`); every mapped base registers its own permastruct, so pagination,
comment pages, feeds, embeds and rewrite endpoints work under all of them.
Stale bases (for example an old `/music/<slug>/` link, or an album whose type
changed) are redirected with a permanent redirect to the canonical URL by
`ReleasePermalinks`, preserving sub-routes and query strings; feeds, embeds,
previews and non-GET requests are left alone.

| Release type | URL base |
|---|---|
| `album` | `/album/<slug>/` |
| `ep` | `/ep/<slug>/` |
| `mix` | `/mix/<slug>/` |
| `playlist` | `/playlist/<slug>/` |
| `single`, `track` | `/track/<slug>/` |
| `podcast_show` | `/podcast/<slug>/` |
| `podcast_episode` | `/episode/<slug>/` |
| no mapped type | `/music/<slug>/` |

When a release carries several mapped types the first match in the order
above wins (collections beat their tracks). Sites can adjust the map through
the `music_wave_release_permalink_bases` filter; bases are sanitized to
lowercase slugs and invalid entries are dropped. `ReleasePermalinks` stores a
fingerprint of the active map in the `music_wave_release_permalink_rules`
option and soft-flushes the rewrite rules on `wp_loaded` whenever the
fingerprint changes, so existing installs (and sites that change the map
through the filter) pick the new structures up on the next request without a
manual permalink re-save. No database schema change is involved.

## Product metadata

| Key | Type | REST | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `_mw_release_ids` | array | No | Reverse index maintained by the product mapper |

## Operational tables

High-cardinality per-user data lives in indexed tables rather than serialized
meta. See `docs/user-data-and-playlists.md` for the rules and REST surface.

| Table | Schema | Purpose | Key indexes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{prefix}mw_download_replays` | 0.9.0 | One-time delivery token replay records | unique `token_hash`, `expires_at` |
| `{prefix}mw_user_activity` | 0.10.0 | Consented listening progress and plays | unique `user+release+event`, `user+updated_at` |
| `{prefix}mw_playlists` | 0.11.0 | User playlists (title, visibility, share token) | unique `share_token`, `user+updated_at` |
| `{prefix}mw_playlist_items` | 0.11.0 | Ordered playlist entries | unique `playlist+release`, `playlist+position`, `release_id` |

## Invariants

- Product IDs must refer to existing `product` posts.
- Release IDs must refer to existing `mw_release` posts.
- `purchase` access requires at least one product mapping.
- `membership` access requires at least one membership level.
- Incomplete paid access configuration is normalized to `restricted`, never to public.
- Artist, genre, mood, and label terms may store private `_mw_metadata_aliases` plus provider-specific IDs. Auto-fill resolves these stable identities before visible names, so translated or renamed terms are reused instead of duplicated.
- Protected asset and external provider identifiers are never public REST fields.
- A protected asset identifier is opaque. Core does not infer a public URL from it.
- A release may contain any number of unique download qualities. Each quality has a unique technical key; quality keys and provider IDs are never exposed in public HTML or REST.
- A quality may store private editor metadata: `file_name`, `format`, `bitrate` (kbps), `duration` (seconds), and `file_size` (bytes). These values are never emitted in public HTML or REST.
- Albums and podcast shows contain tracks or episodes by relation. Add quality variants to each child release once; collections reuse those children without duplicating files.
- Deleting a product removes it from every release mapping without deleting catalog content.
- Deleting a release removes it from every personal library, wishlist, pre-save, and playlist without leaving orphaned rows or gaps in playlist positions.
- Playlist share tokens are capabilities: minted per share, rotated on re-share, never returned to a non-owner, and never resolvable for a private playlist.
- Non-owner playlist views contain published releases only.

## Relationship invariants

- Only collection-shaped release types (`album`, `ep`, `mix`, `playlist`, and `podcast_show`) may own children.
- Track roles accept track/single releases; episode roles accept `podcast_episode` releases and only belong to podcast shows.
- A collection cannot contain itself, a duplicate child, or duplicate positions. Reverse lookups are maintained in private `_mw_collection_ids` metadata.
- REST reads expose the ordered relation for public catalog rendering; writes require `edit_post` on the collection and every referenced release.
